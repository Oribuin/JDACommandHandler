# JDACommandHandler

## What is this?
This is a command handler that can be copied directly into your bot, Use this as a base code for your bot and modify it to suit you
the best. The command handler was designed around Lil' Ori and uses the same functionalities.

## How to use this?
Copy the classes into your bot and modify them however you suits you, The main class has a bot setup in there so you can see how it would
function in a bot, You can also checkout https://github.com/Oribuin/Lil-Ori/ to see the usage in there.

## Misc
Please tell me if there are any improvements I can make to the base design (Most likely comments)
